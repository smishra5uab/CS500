\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_hamming_code}{Hamming\+Code}} \\*Implements (7,4) Hamming Code operations, including encoding, decoding, and error correction. This class provides methods for decoding Hamming (7,4) encoded code words, correcting single-\/bit errors, and detecting multiple errors. It uses matrix multiplication modulo 2 for error detection and correction }{\pageref{class_hamming_code}}{}
